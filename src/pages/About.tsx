        <p>For as long as I remember, I've always had an interest in game development and programming. <br/>
          I'm obsessed with rats, and a theatre nerd. I am currently in school for computer science. <br/>
          Gameplay programming interests me the most, however I also have an interest in graphics <br/>
          programming as well. Being able to interact with or see what you write is the coolest thing.<br/></p>
